Poisk
=====

Command line single-player RPG in Python with a randomly generated and populated world.

Poisk is Russian for "search."

Todo

### Minor

* ~~`kill` function to take either one or two parameters, the second parameter being the target of the `kill` function. Otherwise, use the current target.~~

* When there are multiple rats in a room, target rat should target the first live rat. If there are only corpses of rats, only then should it target the first corpse of a rat. This functionality is supposed to be there already, but it's not working right.

### Major

* Battle system

* Character attributes

* Generated world map
